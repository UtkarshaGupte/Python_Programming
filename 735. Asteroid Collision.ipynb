    "We are given an array asteroids of integers representing asteroids in a row.\n",

    "For each asteroid, the absolute value represents its size, \n",

    "Find out the state of the asteroids after all collisions. \n",
    "If two asteroids meet, the smaller one will explode. If both are the same size, both will explode.\n",
