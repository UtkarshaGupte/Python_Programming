    "71. Simplify Path\n",

    "In a Unix-style file system, a period '.' refers to the current directory, a double period '..' \n",
    "refers to the directory up a level, and any multiple consecutive slashes (i.e. '//') are treated as a single slash '/'. \n",
    "For this problem, any other format of periods such as '...' are treated as file/directory names.\n",
