    "There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. \n",
    "You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi \n",

    "For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.\n",

    "return any of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array.\n",

    "Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0.\n",
    "So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3].\n",
