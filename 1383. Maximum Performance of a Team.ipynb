    "1383. Maximum Performance of a Team\n",
    "You are given two integers n and k and two integer arrays speed and efficiency both of length n. \n",
    "There are n engineers numbered from 1 to n. speed[i] and efficiency[i] represent the speed and efficiency of the \n",

    "Choose at most k different engineers out of the n engineers to form a team with the maximum performance.\n",

    "The performance of a team is the sum of their engineers' speeds multiplied by the minimum efficiency among their engineers.\n",
