    "Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph.\n",

    "For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). \n",
    "For example, the first node with val == 1, the second node with val == 2, and so on. \n",
    "The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.\n",

    "An adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. \n",
    "Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.\n",
